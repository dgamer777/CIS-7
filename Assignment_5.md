a) All students are intelligent. ∀x[S(x)->I(x)]

b) Some intelligent students like music. ∃x[I(x)^S(x)^M(x)]

c) Everyone who likes music is a stupid student. ∀xM(x) -> [I(x)']^S(x)

d) Only intelligent students like music. ∃x[I(x)^S(x)] -> M(x)

25.a) John is handsome and Kathy loves John.

b) All men are handsome.

c) Every woman loves handsome men.

d) Some handsome men love Kathy.

e) Some pretty women only love handsome men.

f) John loves all pretty women.

34.a) Some A(x) and some B(x) does not imply some of A(x)^B(x). If the "and" is replaced with an "or" in the second part of the wff, 
then they would be equivilant.

b) The wff is not valid because something cannot be all and one at the same time.

c) The beginning of the wff states that all P(x) are Q(x) so the next part does not make sense since it is stated that some P(x)
are Q(x).

d) The first part of the wff can be interpreted as "all are not" but the second part can be interpreted as "not all" which is equivilant
to ∃x[A(x)'] but not equivilant to ∀x[A(x)'].
