1. g(a) = (1,2), g(b) = (1,3), g(c) = (2,3) g(d) = (2,2)

2.a. The graph is simple because it has no loops nor parrallel edges.
b. The graph is not complete because not all distinct nodes are adjacent to each other.
c. The graph is connected because there is a path between any two nodes.
d. {3,5,6} and {3,4,5,6}
e. {3,4,5,3}
f. If the edge a5 is removed, the graph will be acyclic since it will not have any possible cycles.
g. If one of the edges a1, a2, a6, or a7 is removed, the graph will no longer be connected.

5. See Graph

9. a. The uncconnected  acquaintanceship graph implies that there is a individuals or groups of people that are not aquainted.
b. Carl and Fletcher are not aquainted because they do not share an adge. SiuYin is only aquainted with one person.
c. The degree of separation is two.

13. "b" is not isomorphic to the other two graphs because it does not contain a node that is separated.

30. |V| - |E| + |R| = 2
     3  -  12 + |R| = 2
     The number of regions are 11.
     
49. The graph has n disconnected nodes with each node having a loop.

50. There no nodes that are connected 

51. The n x n matrix with 0's in the main diagonally with 1's everywhere else.

65. See Graph

71. Most of the matrix will have the opposite numbers where 1's will be 0's and 0's will be 1's except for diagonals which stay 0's.
