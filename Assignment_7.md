If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares. 
This can be proven by a direct proof.The direct proof is the Pythagorean Theorem as it contains three different numbers being squared. 
Since n is a perfect square it can replace z squared in the theorem.
(z)^2 = (x)^2 + (y)^2
n = (x)^2 + (y)^2
 
The sum of two odd integers is even. Direct proof.
(2m+1) + (2n+1) = 2p
2m +2n + 2 = 2p
m + n + 1 = p
By defintion of an even number, if it can be divided by 2, it is an even number. Since all the integers were divided by two, the sum
will be an even integer.

The sum of an even integer and it's square is even. Direct proof.
2n + (2n)^2 = 2m
n + n^2 = m
By definition of an even number.

If n squared is odd, then n is odd. Proof by contradiction.
E = If n squared is odd, then n is even.
(2n+1)^2 is odd then n is even
(2n+1)(2n+1) is odd then n is even
4n^2 +4n + 1 is odd then n is even
By law of an odd number we know n will be an odd number because of the plus one.
n is odd then n is even <- contradiction.
E'' = E
