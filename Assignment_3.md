1.1 Review Questions

#35. If the value is less than 5.0 and less than 10.7 after being multiplied by 2, then the code will output the number.
1.0 and 2.4 will be output numbers because they fullfill the above requirements.
The secondary fullfillment is if the value is less than 5.1 after being multiplied by 5 and taking the square root of it.
5.3 and 7.2 wil be output numbers.

#37. ((Value1 < Value2)' v odd(number)) v ((Value1 < Value2)' ^ odd(Number)) -> statement1 else statement2
     The odd(Number) cancel because of the the "and or". 
if not (Value1 < Value2) then statement1 else statement2 end if

#38. (A = F, B = F, C = T) -> Statement 1
    (A ^ B)' ^ C does not execute since A and B are within the parenthesis are true.

#61. If Percival is a liar, then the statement is false which means both are truth-tellers but that is impossible because we assumed
Percival is a liar. Percival is the truthteller which means "At least one of us is a liar" is a true statment which means Llewellyn
is the liar.

#62. The statement is A -> B which means that either both statements are true or both statements are false. The statements cannot be both
false because that would imply a truth which means that Merlin and Meredith are both truthtellers.

#63. The statement is A v B. If Rothwold is a liar then the statment becomes A v B' but since he is a liar the statement becomes A' v B'
which equals a truth. By this logic, Rothwold is a truthteller which indicates that Grymlin is also a truthteller.

#64. A ^ B' Gwendolin is a liar because she cannot be a truthteller. She states "I am a liar but Marrilaine is not" which implies "and" so
the both statements need to be true for Gwendolin to be truthteller which is not possible for the truthteller. Since Gwendolin is a liar,
the second statement is not true which implies Marrilaine is also a liar.
