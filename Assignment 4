p->q and 'p->'q are not logically equivilant because of thier opposite nature. If p is false and q is true, it would make a false
arguement but if 'p is false and 'q is true then the arguement is true.

(p->r) ^ (q->r) <=> (p v q) -> r are logically equivilant. Since (p v q) is true as long as both statements are not false and there is
a "^" symbol between (p->r) and (q->r), it can be interpreted as (p v q) -> r.

Are (pvq) v r and ((p^q) ^ r)' logically equivilant?

Are (p^q)' and p' v q' logically equivilant?
